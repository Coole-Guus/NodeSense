# NodeSense
This repository provides the implementation for the proposed NodeSense urban sound classifier.
For the peak detection section and demo of the code can be found in the ./recording/ file. 
For the model training we provide the train.py in the root of the repository.

## Peak detection
The peak detection/demo application can be run using the following commands.
```bash
pip install -r ./recording/requirements.txt
python ./recording/start.py
```

## Classifier training
The classifier model can be run using the following commands
```
pip install -r ./requirements.txt
